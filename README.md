# Yelp Review Sentiment Analysis and Classification

A comprehensive NLP (Natural Language Processing) project designed to predict the sentiment of Yelp reviews (1 star vs. 5 stars) using a combination of text vectorization (TF-IDF) and engineered linguistic/semantic features.

## Objective

The primary goal is to build a highly interpretable and robust binary classifier to distinguish between explicitly negative (1-star) and positive (5-star) reviews. The dataset has a strong class imbalance (81.7% positive, 18.3% negative), which requires tracking specialized metrics (`F1-macro`, `PR AUC`) and applying algorithmic weighting (`class_weight='balanced'`).

## Tech Stack and Methodology

* **Text Processing:** `SpaCy` (lemmatization, custom negation preservation), `NLTK`, Regular Expressions.
* **Feature Engineering:**
  * Structural metrics (word count, sentence count, punctuation density).
  * Semantic lexicons (`VADER`, `AFINN`, `Bing`, `NRC Emotion Lexicon`, `TextBlob`).


* **Feature Selection:** `SmartCorrelatedSelection` (to eliminate multicollinearity) and `Sequential Feature Selection` (SFS).
* **Transformations:** `Yeo-Johnson` for skewed numerical distributions, `MinMaxScaler`, `TF-IDF` with sublinear scaling.
* **Modeling (`scikit-learn`, `xgboost`):** Evaluation of Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost.

## Key Results and Insights

### Model Performance

The best performing model was **Logistic Regression (Text + Features)**. Linear models demonstrated high stability, effectively extracting hidden patterns without overfitting on the training data.

* **F1-macro (Test):** 0.922
* **Balanced Accuracy:** 0.929
* **PR AUC (Class 0):** 0.934
* *Tree-based models (such as XGBoost and Random Forest) demonstrated a high proneness to overfitting (the generalization gap was 11–13%).*

### Meta-features

Combining raw TF-IDF tokens with engineered structural and semantic features significantly improved the detection of the minority negative class. For example, `PR AUC` for Class 0 increased from 0.926 to 0.934 when meta-features were added to the Logistic Regression pipeline.

### Top Features

Analysis of the model coefficients revealed the most significant predictors:

* **Positive Class:** `polarity`, `score_vader`, and slang tokens (`love`, `awesome`, `bomb`).
* **Negative Class:** The negation particle `not` (preserved due to custom SpaCy cleaning), specific domain markers (`food`, `bland`, `greasy`, `overpriced`), and the `nrc_neg_norm` lexicon score.

### Error Analysis

False positive triggers (predicting positive for actual negative reviews) were primarily caused by the fundamental limitations of the Bag-of-Words/TF-IDF approach:

* Inability to recognize sarcasm.
* Misattribution of positive tokens when the review author praises a competitor (another restaurant).
* Blindness to temporal context (e.g., praising how good things *used to be*).
